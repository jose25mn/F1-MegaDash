You are a senior UI/UX designer and front-end architect.

I want you to design and generate the front-end code for a **Formula 1 analytics web app** called **"F1 Mega Dashboard"**.

### 1. Tech stack and structure

- Use **React + TypeScript + Vite**.
- Organize the app like this:

  src/
    App.tsx
    main.tsx
    index.css
    components/
      DashboardCard.tsx
      PageHeader.tsx
      SectionTitle.tsx
      FiltersBar.tsx
      DataTable.tsx
      KpiCard.tsx
    pages/
      OverviewPage.tsx
      SeasonPage.tsx
      CircuitsPage.tsx
      TeamsPage.tsx
      DriversPage.tsx

- The app will later consume data from a backend REST API (FastAPI + PostgreSQL), but for now use **mocked data** and **clean props** so that it is easy to plug real data later (e.g. props like `topDriversAllTime`, `constructorWinsBySeason`, etc.).

### 2. Global layout and navigation

Design a **dark, cinematic F1-style dashboard** inspired by professional BI tools and modern F1 apps (without using official logos or trademarks).

Global layout:

- A **full-width top bar** with:
  - App title: **"F1 Mega Dashboard"** on the left.
  - Navigation tabs: `"Overview"`, `"Circuits"`, `"Teams"`, `"Drivers"`, `"Season"`.
  - On the right side: a **Season selector** (dropdown) with years from 2024 down to 1950.

- Below the top bar, a main content area:
  - Centered **dashboard frame** with max-width and full height.
  - Background: dark gradient (e.g. #050810, #090d18).
  - Cards: slightly lighter panels (e.g. #101626, #141a2b) with rounded corners and soft inner shadows.

Navigation behavior:

- `App.tsx` must manage the active view with a simple state machine, like:

  - Type: `"overview" | "circuits" | "teams" | "drivers" | "season"`.
  - Top bar buttons switch the active view.
  - The selected season is stored in state and passed as prop to pages.

- The main content area renders:

  - `<OverviewPage season={season} />`
  - `<CircuitsPage season={season} />`
  - `<TeamsPage season={season} />`
  - `<DriversPage season={season} />`
  - `<SeasonPage season={season} />`

### 3. Design system and reusable components

Create a small design system:

- **Colors:**
  - Global background: very dark blue/gray (`#050810`, `#090d18`).
  - Card background: `#101626` / `#141a2b`.
  - Accents: reds/oranges for highlights and active items.
  - Borders: subtle, semi-transparent (e.g. `rgba(255,255,255,0.06)`).

- **Typography:**
  - Modern, slightly condensed, numeric-friendly.
  - Card titles in uppercase with small letter spacing.
  - KPIs with large, bold numeric styling.

- **Shared components:**

  1. `DashboardCard`
     - Props: `title`, optional `subtitle`, `children`.
     - Layout: header (title + subtitle) and body content area.

  2. `PageHeader`
     - Props: `title`, `subtitle`.
     - Used at the top of each page (within the dashboard frame).

  3. `SectionTitle`
     - Simple sub-section title within a page.

  4. `FiltersBar`
     - Horizontal bar with possible children, good spacing and pill-like controls.

  5. `DataTable`
     - Reusable table component supporting:
       - Column headers
       - Rows
       - Hover states
       - Optional compact mode
     - Head fixed, scrollable body if height is limited.

  6. `KpiCard`
     - For key numeric stats.
     - Props like: `label`, `value`, optional `hint`.

- Use simple chart placeholders (you can use a typical chart library syntax OR just structured markup indicating where charts will go). The goal is **to have clear components that can later be wired to real chart libraries** such as Recharts or similar.

### 4. Page: Overview (global stats)

File: `src/pages/OverviewPage.tsx`

Goal: give a **high-level view** of F1 performance, mixing all-time stats and current-season data.

Layout:

1. **Page header:**
   - Title: `Overview`
   - Subtitle: `Global Formula 1 stats and current season highlights.`

2. **Top KPI strip (3 big KPI cards):**
   - KPI 1: `TOTAL WINS (TOP 10 DRIVERS)` – big numeric value, subtitle `Historical total`.
   - KPI 2: `TEAMS WITH WINS THIS SEASON` – number of different teams that won a race in the selected season.
   - KPI 3: `DISTINCT RESULT STATUSES THIS SEASON` – number of result types (Finished, Engine, Accident, +1 Lap, etc.).

3. **Row 1 – two charts:**
   - Left: `DashboardCard` titled `TOP DRIVERS BY WINS (ALL TIME)`:
     - Horizontal or vertical bar chart (mock data).
   - Right: `DashboardCard` titled `WINS BY TEAM – SEASON [YEAR]`:
     - Bar chart (constructors on x-axis, wins on y-axis).

4. **Row 2 – table and pie chart:**
   - Left: `DashboardCard` titled `TOP DRIVERS – SEASON [YEAR] (FINAL POINTS)`:
     - Table with columns: Position, Driver, Team, Points.
   - Right: `DashboardCard` titled `RESULT STATUS DISTRIBUTION – SEASON [YEAR]`:
     - Pie chart (or donut) showing distribution of statuses.

Use mocked data, but design the components with props like:
- `topDriversAllTime`
- `constructorWinsBySeason`
- `driverStandingsBySeason`
- `statusDistributionBySeason`

     - Description placeholder.

   - Below details, two compact charts:
     - Bar chart: `Top Drivers at this Circuit (Wins)`.

Mocked data; future props:
- `driversList`
- `driverProfile`
- `driverSeasonsStats`
- `driverRecentResults`

---

### 9. Visual style and UX behavior

- Dark mode by default with subtle gradients.
- Use significant padding and spacing between cards to avoid clutter.
- Smooth hover states for buttons, tabs, list items and table rows.
- Active navigation tab should be clearly highlighted using accent color and maybe an underline.
- The design should feel like a **premium data product for motorsport analysts**, not a simple CRUD app.

---

### 10. Deliverables

Generate:

1. The complete React + TypeScript code for:
   - `App.tsx` with tab navigation and season selector.
   - All pages (`OverviewPage`, `SeasonPage`, `CircuitsPage`, `TeamsPage`, `DriversPage`).
   - Shared components (`DashboardCard`, `PageHeader`, `SectionTitle`, `FiltersBar`, `DataTable`, `KpiCard`).
   - Basic global styling in `index.css`.

2. Use mocked data inside the pages/components, but keep the data flow designed so later I can replace these mocks with real API calls to endpoints like:
   - `/api/top-drivers-wins`
   - `/api/constructors-wins`
   - `/api/driver-standings`
   - `/api/status-distribution`
   - `/api/circuits`
   - `/api/constructors`
   - `/api/drivers`

Focus on clean code structure, premium UX and a visually impressive F1 analytics interface.
